        <h1>How did K-pop grow so fast?</h1>
        <p>
          In 2012, K-pop took a leap forward in the music industry. In summer
          Psy set several unprecedented records on music charts and gained
          international stardom with his megahit “Gangnam Style”. Who made K-pop
          famous worldwide? Fashion. The emergence of Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992
          paved the way for the development of contemporary K-pop groups. The
          group revolutionized the Korean music scene by incorporating rap and
          American hip hop conventions into their music. How did K-pop become so
          big? K-pop has become a truly global phenomenon thanks to its
          distinctive blend of addictive melodies, slick choreography and
          production values and an endless parade of attractive south Korean
          performers who spend years in grueling studio systems learning to sing
          and dance in synchronized perfection. How did K-pop impact the world?
          K-pop idols and their music have positively contributed to south
          Korean diplomacy economy and human rights movements and the country’s
          global status for decades especially during times of high political
          tension.
